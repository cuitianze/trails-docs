## What is Trails ?
Trails is a modern, community-driven web application framework for node.js. It
builds on the pedigree of [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [Grails](https://grails.org/)
to accelerate development by adhering to a straightforward, convention-based,
API-driven design philosophy.
